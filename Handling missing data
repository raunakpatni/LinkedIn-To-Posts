Handling Missing Values in Data:                                                   
                                                 There are many ways to approach missing data. The most common, I believe, is to ignore it. which may or may not be a bad choice, depending on why and how much data are missing.  But there are also ways to impute those missing values:

• Mean: the mean of the observed values for that variable

• Mode: the most occuring observed value for that variable

• linear interpolation : The previous valid values before the missing value and the following valid values after the missing value are used for the interpolation.

• Substitution: the value from a new individual who was not selected to be in the sample

• Hot deck: a randomly chosen value from an individual who has similar values on other variables

• Cold deck: a systematically chosen value from an individual who has similar values on other variables

• Regression: the predicted value obtained by regressing the missing variable on other variables

• KNN: point value can be approximated by the values of the points that are closest to it, based on other variables.
